The four parts of venture capital (VC) that are commonly mentioned include:

# Fundraising
This involves raising capital from limited partners (LPs) such as institutional investors, high-net-worth individuals, and family offices. A VC firm must effectively communicate its investment strategy, potential returns, and track record to attract investment.

# Deal Sourcing
This refers to the process of finding and evaluating potential investment opportunities. VC firms often rely on their networks, industry events, and referrals to discover startups or companies that align with their investment thesis.

# Due Diligence
Once a potential investment is identified, VCs conduct thorough due diligence to assess the financial health, market potential, competitive landscape, and management team of the company. This phase is critical for making informed investment decisions.

# Portfolio Management
After investing, VCs actively manage their portfolio companies by providing strategic guidance, operational support, and connections. This part involves monitoring performance and making decisions regarding follow-on funding, exits, or other strategic actions to maximize returns.

These components work together to create a comprehensive venture capital strategy that aims to identify high-potential companies and support them through their growth stages.

Ventro lets VCs embed an AI agent that makes sure they never miss out on deal sourcing. Any founder can upload their deck or document and have a conversation with the partner that is in charge of their vertical.

The VC will then be able to review the company with their usual process but with a significant amount of data and time saved. 

The platform will be able to generate a report with the following sections:
