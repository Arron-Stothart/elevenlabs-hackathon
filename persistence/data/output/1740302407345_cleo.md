# PROBLEM
Millennials don't like or **trust** their bank anymore
NO CONTROL
No one wants to spend 4 hours in excel to understand where their money is going.
EXTORTIONATE FEES
Hidden fees and sneaky charges don't sit well with a price sensitive and hyper-informed
generation.
INCONVENIENT
Call centers and seven passwords to remember? No, thanks.


# PROBLEM

# 73% of Millennials would rather bank with Facebook, Google or Apple than their current bank.
