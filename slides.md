Let's look at the experience for a founder.
(DEMO VIDEO)

We give founders the chance to introduce and pitch themselves.
(in a future version we'll use a real-time speech to video model to not only replicate the voice of the partner but also the body language and facial expressions)

Partners can review the deck, chat with the transcript and have notes generated for them in whatever style they want.

We believe Ventro should integrate with your existing workflow not replace it.

How does this work?

- Parse the deck or document using VLMs -> informs the Agent through dynamic variables
- Replicate the voice of the partner (Eleven Labs)
- Gemini to generate notes and let you chat with the transcript

Eleven Labs conversational AI SDK (knowledge base, voice cloning)
Allowing each partner to customise the notes, call length and much more.
